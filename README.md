# Typing Game Assignment

## Acceptance Criteria
- Help! My code is not working although I took it all from Stack Overflow. The way it should work is when you load up the page, a target letter should appear on the left side of the screen and the user needs to match it on the right side of the screen. When the user types a letter the app should indicate if they typed the correct letter or not.

## Current Issues
- I want the text to centered on the screen, but it is left-aligned for some reason.
- The letter on the left is marked as undefined.
- When I type a letter, nothing happens.
- Correct/Incorrect pop-up is supposed to go away but doesn't.
- Correct/Incorrect pop-up is wrong.

## Extra Credit
- When I load the page, I want the app to default the right input to be highlighted so the user doesn't have to click on it.
- How can I clean up the code?
